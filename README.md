IVDC's Projects for IITISoC '23

## **IVR1 - Lane detection using limited computation power Intermediate**

Description: Autonomous Vehicles require advanced lane detection algorithms to
perceive lanes on the road( Street as well as rough road lanes). Develop a robust
lane detection pipeline that consumes meager computational resources (No GPU
allowed, limited CPU and RAM usage) and could be deployed on NVIDIA Jetson
Nano Board or even a Raspberry Pi board. If this project is successful, you will
be involved in actually implementing your software on a real-world vehicle (in the
autonomous vehicle team of the IVDC club), especially for IGVC International
Competition

Specification:
• Computer Vision, DL, Pytorch/Tensorflow

## **IVR2 - Autonomous Navigation for Vehicles in Rough Terrain**[Mathworks](https://github.com/mathworks/MathWorks-Excellence-in-Innovation/tree/main/projects/Autonomous%20Navigation%20for%20Vehicles%20in%20Rough%20Terrain)

Advanced
Description: Demo a robot/vehicle (AMR, front loader, excavator, curiosity mars
rover) working in a cluttered field (off-road) moving from point A to point B. The
field should have minor bumps and ditches

Specification:
• Autonomous Vehicles, Computer Vision, Robotics, Image Processing, Mobile
Robots, SLAM, UGV, Optimization , MATLAB

## **IVR3 - Underwater Drone Hide and Seek**[Mathworks](https://github.com/mathworks/MathWorks-Excellence-in-Innovation/tree/main/projects/Underwater%20Drone%20Hide%20and%20Seek)

Intermediate
Description: Design algorithms for underwater drones to compete in a hostile
situation, where a first drone is trying to stay stealth and a second drone is actively
searching for the first drone. Develop an algorithm to navigate a stealth underwater
drone without being detected. Develop another algorithm to navigate a second
underwater drone to search for the stealth drone.

Specification:
• Underwater Drones, Control, Optimisation, Game Theory/RL, Military

## **IVR4 - Make a Pet-Quadruped Robot** [Mathworks](https://github.com/chvmp/champ)

Beginner
Description: Import a CAD model of the Quadruped robot in Gazebo and use
relevant MathWorks packages and open-source libraries to control its movement.
It must be able to perform certain pre-determined tasks involving human-robot
interaction. You may get a chance to use your code on a similar quadruped robot
for the Robotics Club(post-IITISOC).

Specification:
• Quadruped Robots, Control, Path planning, Human-Robot Interaction

## **IVR5 - Path Planning for Autonomous Race Cars** [Mathworks](https://github.com/mathworks/MathWorks-Excellence-in-Innovation/tree/main/projects/Path%20Planning%20for%20Autonomous%20Race%20Cars)

Intermediate
Description: Finding an optimal racing line can be considered an optimization
problem. Work with MATLAB® and the Optimization Toolbox™ to develop the
algorithm.

Specification:
• Autonomous Vehicles, Optimization Techniques/ RL, Modeling and Simulation
, MATLAB
